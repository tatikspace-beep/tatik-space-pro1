    // Tutorial 1: Introduction
    introStep1Title: "Create your account",
    introStep1Content: "Sign up on Tatik.space Pro and access the main dashboard. You will find the 'New Project' button in the top right corner. Choose a name for your workspace and select the region closest to you for better performance.",
    introStep2Title: "Choose a template",
    introStep2Content: "Select one of the available templates: React, Next.js, Node.js, or an empty project. Templates already include pre-configured base dependencies, so you can start coding immediately without wasting time on setup.",
    introStep3Title: "Start your workspace",
    introStep3Content: "The workspace starts in a few seconds. The development server is already active on port 3000 and the editor is ready to use. Open the browser preview on the right to see your app in real time.",
    // Tutorial 2: Editor Usage
    editorStep1Title: "Navigate the interface",
    editorStep1Content: "The main editor is divided into: file panel on the left, code area in the center, and integrated terminal at the bottom. You can resize each panel by dragging the separators. The search button (Ctrl+Shift+F) searches across all project files.",
    editorStep2Title: "Essential shortcuts",
    editorStep2Content: "The most useful shortcuts: Ctrl+P to open files quickly, Ctrl+Shift+P for the command palette, Alt+Click for multi-cursor, Ctrl+D to select next occurrence. Use Ctrl+/ to comment/uncomment selected lines.",
    editorStep3Title: "Configure the theme",
    editorStep3Content: "Go to Settings > Appearance to customize theme, font size and editor layout. You can choose between dark and light themes, and adjust the font to improve readability during long coding sessions.",
    // Tutorial 3: AI Code
    aiStep1Title: "Open the AI panel",
    aiStep1Content: "Press Ctrl+K or click the AI icon in the sidebar to open the intelligent assistance panel. The AI has full context of your open files and can suggest solutions based on your current code.",
    aiStep2Title: "Generate code with a prompt",
    aiStep2Content: "Write a natural language description of what you want to achieve. The AI will generate complete code with TypeScript types included. The more specific your prompt, the better the result will be.",
    aiStep3Title: "Fix errors automatically",
    aiStep3Content: "Highlight code with errors and press Alt+Enter to receive AI correction suggestions with explanation. The AI can also analyze error messages from the terminal and propose targeted fixes.",
    // Tutorial 4: Real-time Collaboration
    collabStep1Title: "Invite collaborators",
    collabStep1Content: "From the project dashboard, click 'Share' and enter the collaborator's email. You can assign roles: Viewer (read only), Editor (can modify code), or Admin (full access including settings).",
    collabStep2Title: "Work in sync",
    collabStep2Content: "You will see your colleagues' cursors in real time with their name and an assigned color. Changes appear instantly for everyone without refresh. The integrated chat allows you to communicate without leaving the editor.",
    collabStep3Title: "Open a review session",
    collabStep3Content: "Use the 'Review Mode' function to leave inline comments on specific lines of code, similar to GitHub Pull Request. Reviewers can approve or request changes, keeping a complete revision history.",
    // Tutorial 5: File Management
    filesStep1Title: "Recommended project structure",
    filesStep1Content: "Use a scalable structure to keep code organized as the project grows. Tatik.space Pro suggests a standard structure for React projects, but you can customize it based on your team's conventions.",
    filesStep2Title: "Configure import aliases",
    filesStep2Content: "Configure tsconfig.json to use aliases like '@/components' instead of long relative paths. This makes code cleaner and more maintainable. Tatik.space Pro automatically updates the aliases in the editor.",
    filesStep3Title: "Manage dependencies",
    filesStep3Content: "The 'Packages' panel lets you install, update and remove npm packages without using the terminal. You can also view available updates and changelog for each package directly in the interface.",
    // Tutorial 6: Project Deployment
    deployStep1Title: "Choose the platform",
    deployStep1Content: "Click 'Deploy' in the top bar. You can choose between Tatik Cloud (integrated hosting with automatic SSL and CDN), Vercel or Netlify. Each option has a guided wizard that walks you through all the settings.",
    deployStep2Title: "Configure environment variables",
    deployStep2Content: "Before deploying, go to Settings > Environment Variables and add your API keys and sensitive variables. These are encrypted and never exposed in the source code or in build logs.",
    deployStep3Title: "Automatic deploy with CI/CD",
    deployStep3Content: "Connect your GitHub repository: every push to the main branch will automatically trigger a new deploy with live preview. You can also configure deploy rules by branch for staging environments.",

    // Tutorial 1: Introduction
    introStep1Title: "Crea il tuo account",
    introStep1Content: "Registrati su Tatik.space Pro e accedi alla dashboard principale. Troverai il pulsante 'Nuovo Progetto' in alto a destra. Scegli un nome per il tuo workspace e seleziona la regione più vicina a te per prestazioni migliori.",
    introStep2Title: "Scegli un template",
    introStep2Content: "Seleziona uno dei template disponibili: React, Next.js, Node.js, o un progetto vuoto. I template includono già le dipendenze di base configurate, così puoi iniziare a scrivere codice immediatamente senza perdere tempo nel setup.",
    introStep3Title: "Avvia il tuo workspace",
    introStep3Content: "Il workspace si avvia in pochi secondi. Il server di sviluppo è già attivo sulla porta 3000 e l'editor è pronto all'uso. Apri l'anteprima browser a destra per vedere la tua app in tempo reale.",
    // Tutorial 2: Editor Usage
    editorStep1Title: "Navigare l'interfaccia",
    editorStep1Content: "L'editor principale è diviso in: pannello file a sinistra, area di codice al centro e terminale integrato in basso. Puoi ridimensionare ogni pannello trascinando i separatori. Il pulsante di ricerca (Ctrl+Shift+F) cerca in tutti i file del progetto.",
    editorStep2Title: "Shortcut essenziali",
    editorStep2Content: "I shortcut più utili: Ctrl+P per aprire file rapidamente, Ctrl+Shift+P per il pannello comandi, Alt+Click per multi-cursore, Ctrl+D per selezionare l'occorrenza successiva. Usa Ctrl+/ per commentare/decommentare le righe selezionate.",
    editorStep3Title: "Configurare il tema",
    editorStep3Content: "Vai su Impostazioni > Aspetto per personalizzare tema, font size e layout dell'editor. Puoi scegliere tra tema scuro e chiaro, e regolare il font per migliorare la leggibilità durante le sessioni di codice lunghe.",
    // Tutorial 3: AI Code
    aiStep1Title: "Aprire il pannello AI",
    aiStep1Content: "Premi Ctrl+K oppure clicca sull'icona AI nella barra laterale per aprire il pannello di assistenza intelligente. L'AI ha pieno contesto dei tuoi file aperti e può suggerire soluzioni basate sul tuo codice attuale.",
    aiStep2Title: "Generare codice con un prompt",
    aiStep2Content: "Scrivi una descrizione naturale di cosa vuoi ottenere. L'AI genererà il codice completo con TypeScript types inclusi. Più il tuo prompt è specifico, migliore sarà il risultato.",
    aiStep3Title: "Correggere errori automaticamente",
    aiStep3Content: "Evidenzia il codice con errori e premi Alt+Enter per ricevere suggerimenti di correzione dall'AI con spiegazione. L'AI può anche analizzare i messaggi di errore del terminale e proporre fix mirati.",
    // Tutorial 4: Real-time Collaboration
    collabStep1Title: "Invitare collaboratori",
    collabStep1Content: "Dalla dashboard del progetto, clicca 'Condividi' e inserisci l'email del collaboratore. Puoi assegnare ruoli: Viewer (sola lettura), Editor (può modificare il codice), o Admin (accesso completo incluse le impostazioni).",
    collabStep2Title: "Lavorare in sincronia",
    collabStep2Content: "Vedrai i cursori dei tuoi colleghi in tempo reale con il loro nome e un colore assegnato. Le modifiche appaiono istantaneamente per tutti senza refresh. La chat integrata ti permette di comunicare senza uscire dall'editor.",
    collabStep3Title: "Aprire una sessione di review",
    collabStep3Content: "Usa la funzione 'Review Mode' per lasciare commenti inline su righe specifiche di codice, simile a GitHub Pull Request. I revisori possono approvare o richiedere modifiche, mantenendo uno storico completo delle revisioni.",
    // Tutorial 5: File Management
    filesStep1Title: "Struttura consigliata del progetto",
    filesStep1Content: "Usa una struttura scalabile per mantenere il codice organizzato man mano che il progetto cresce. Tatik.space Pro suggerisce una struttura standard per i progetti React, ma puoi personalizzarla in base alle convenzioni del tuo team.",
    filesStep2Title: "Configurare gli alias di import",
    filesStep2Content: "Configura tsconfig.json per usare alias come '@/components' invece di percorsi relativi lunghi. Questo rende il codice più pulito e manutenibile. Tatik.space Pro aggiorna automaticamente gli alias nell'editor.",
    filesStep3Title: "Gestire le dipendenze",
    filesStep3Content: "Il pannello 'Packages' ti permette di installare, aggiornare e rimuovere pacchetti npm senza usare il terminale. Puoi anche visualizzare gli aggiornamenti disponibili e il changelog per ogni pacchetto direttamente nell'interfaccia.",
    // Tutorial 6: Project Deployment
    deployStep1Title: "Scegli la piattaforma",
    deployStep1Content: "Clicca 'Deploy' nella barra in alto. Puoi scegliere tra Tatik Cloud (hosting integrato con SSL automatico e CDN), Vercel o Netlify. Ogni opzione ha una procedura guidata che ti guida attraverso tutte le impostazioni.",
    deployStep2Title: "Configurare le variabili d'ambiente",
    deployStep2Content: "Prima di distribuire, vai su Impostazioni > Variabili d'ambiente e aggiungi le tue chiavi API e variabili sensibili. Questi sono crittografati e mai esposti nel codice sorgente o nei log di compilazione.",
    deployStep3Title: "Deploy automatico con CI/CD",
    deployStep3Content: "Connetti il tuo repository GitHub: ogni push nel ramo principale attiverà automaticamente un nuovo deploy con anteprima live. Puoi anche configurare le regole di deploy per ramo per gli ambienti di staging.",
